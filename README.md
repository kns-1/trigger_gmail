# trigger_gmail
As a part of my project on Internet of Things, this was the code written in Python which automtically sends a mail to Gmail account whenever an event is triggered.
In this code, whenever the door of the temple is opened, then a mail will be sent to the specified Gmail account stating that the door is opened.
